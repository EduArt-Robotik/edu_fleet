This package provides control software for a fleet application in which three robots drive together in a formation. The package is based on the paper: **Hierarchical Multi-Robot Fleet Architecture with a
Kinematics-adaptive Drive System** .

Unfortunately the documentation is still missing. If you have any questions, please contact [Christian Wendt](mailto:christian.wendt@eduart-robotik.com).
